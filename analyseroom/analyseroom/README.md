# Mobile App

The mobile part of AnalyseRoom has simple screens design to show users which professor is teaching inside the locked room. It's displays the entry and left schedules, professors's name and subject! 

All the professor data is stored on Firebase Real Time Database and is created on the biometric sign up.

Once a request came from the sensor to the app, it catch the available information from database and print on the screen.

Also, if exist any doubt or bug on the app, it allow you to contact me by sending a email.
