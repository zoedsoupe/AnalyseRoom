# Arduino Sensors

The main sensor on this project is the Adafruit fingerprint sensor. It has the ability to create, enroll, list, delete and recognise fingerprints. We used it to handle the lock and unlock of doors.

A servo motor was used to be represent a door lock and receives the command from the fingerprint sensor.

The internet shield was used to give Arduino the ability to make HTTP requests to our web server.
